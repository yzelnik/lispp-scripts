This folder demonstrates calculations and shows results for the manuscript "Linking intrinsic scales of ecological processes to characteristic scales of biodiversity and functioning patterns".

The two main script files to run are:
1) Make5x5Plot.m
2) SpecificPoints.m

Besides Matlab, you need to download the library RDM at:
https://github.com/yzelnik/RDM

After that, you "install" the library by running the script: setrdmpath.m

You can then open each script separately, and run it in several steps, by clicking each section (shown in yellow) and using Ctrl+Enter to run each section consecutively.

Running the full simulations can take a very long time to run (e.g. weeks), so that changing a few key parameters can make running things much faster while giving results that are generally similar (but not as robust). This is shown at the end of the first section of each script file, where several lines can be un-commented to make for a much quicker run-time.
